**Overall:**
Great work on this assignment! Not many notes on my end. Continue practicing your Python skills and keep brushing up on your math/stats.

**Some notes**  
* While there is nothing incorrect about your hypothesis, they are typically a bit more direct and declarative. For example, you might change this to: GRE is the greatest indicator of admission to grad school.
* How might outliers impact our models?
